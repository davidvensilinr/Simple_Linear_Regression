# Simple Linear Regression Models

This repository specifically focuses on understanding and building Linear Regression models to solve different types of problems. It includes practical implementations and datasets to demonstrate these concepts.

## Projects

### 1. Score Prediction Model
*   **Description**: A simple linear regression model that predicts the number of minutes a student needs to study to achieve a specific score (or vice versa, depending on the model's formulation).
*   **Input**: Marks
*   **Output**: Time (minutes)
*   **File**: `scores.ipynb`
*   **Key Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

### 2. Salary Prediction (Dataset)
*   **Description**: A dataset provided to practice building prediction models. It contains data conducive to linear regression analysis, relating salary to factors like experience.
*   **Dataset Location**: `salary_prediction/dataset/salary.csv`
*   **Features**:
    *   Experience
    *   Age
    *   Education
    *   Location
    *   Salary (Target Variable)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3.  Open `scores.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment to run the Score Prediction model.
